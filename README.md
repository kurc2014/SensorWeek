# SensorWeek

Welcome to the **SensorWeek** repository! This project contains all the code, resources, and materials used during the **5-day Sensor Week** organized by the **Kathmandu University Robotics Club (KURC)**. 

### About the Event
The Sensor Week event was a hands-on workshop aimed at introducing participants to various sensors used in robotics, automation, and IoT applications. Over the course of five days, participants gained practical experience by working on sensor-based projects, learning to interface sensors with microcontrollers, and exploring how sensors play a crucial role in building smart systems.

### Repository Contents
This repository includes:
- **Code** for interfacing and using various sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity, proximity, etc.).
- **Project Files** and examples developed during the workshop.
- **Documentation** to guide users through the sensor projects and code used in the event.

### Getting Started
To get started with the projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kurc2014/SensorWeek.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Depending on the sensor you're working with, you may need to install specific libraries (e.g., Adafruit Sensor library, Arduino IDE).

3. **Upload Code to your Microcontroller:**  
   Use the provided `.ino` files with the Arduino IDE or another compatible platform.

4. **Follow the Instructions:**  
   Check the respective project directories for documentation on how to use the sensors and interact with the code.

### Contributing
